# tsp-with-penalty
In this variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), each city carries a penalty if it is not  visited and it is asked that how can we minimize the value of the length of the tour plus the  penalties for the not visited cities. This is the second project assignment for Analysis of Algorithms course.
